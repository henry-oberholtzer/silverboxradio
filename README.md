```
$ python
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.SystemRandom().getrandbits(128)
YOUR_SECRET_KEY_WILL_BE_HERE
```
- Change `dotenv` to `.env` and paste your secret key in "SECRET_KEY". Set other configuration settings as needed.
- Follow the commands below to install and get flask running.
```
$ cd ./api
$ python3.12 -m venv .venv
# Next line is for MacOS / Linux
